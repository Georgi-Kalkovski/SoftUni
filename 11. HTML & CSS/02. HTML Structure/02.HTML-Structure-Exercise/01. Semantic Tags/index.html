            When I gave birth in early September, I knew it would change my life. What I wasn’t aware of, though, was
            just how
            much it would transform me and my daily life in every single way.

            Tending to my crying babe takes precedence over looking in the mirror. 30-minute showers have become swift
            splashes.
            Makeup doesn’t matter nearly as much. My skin care routine is less of a routine and more of an infrequent
            luxury.
