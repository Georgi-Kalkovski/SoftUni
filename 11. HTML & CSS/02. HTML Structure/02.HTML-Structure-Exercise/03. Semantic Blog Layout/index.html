                    The Woman Who Outruns the Men, 200 Miles at a Time

                    Courtney Dauwalter specializes in extremely long races. But her success in winning them has opened a
                    debate about
                    how men’s innate strength advantages apply to endurance sports.

                    She saw live puppets playing on a swing set on the side of the trail. Trees and rocks turned into
                    faces. She was on
                    her second night without sleep, 165 miles into a 205-mile race through the mountains, pushing her
                    body to levels
                    considered physically impossible not long ago, and seeing very strange things in the night.

                <h4>
                    V.A.R. at the Women’s World Cup? FIFA Still Won’t Say
                </h4>
                <p>
                    PARIS — As the men’s World Cup was winding down last summer in Russia, FIFA’s president, Gianni
                    Infantino, used his
                    final news conference to heap praise on the video assistant referee system, which had been used for
                    the first time
                    at the tournament. It had become, Infantino declared, “difficult to think about the World Cup
                    without V.A.R.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    It remains to be seen whether Infantino was referring only to the men’s game when he essentially
                    called the
                    technology indispensable.To the dismay of some top players and coaches in the women’s game, FIFA,
                    the governing body
                    of international soccer, has not confirmed whether V.A.R. will be used at the Women’s World Cup next
                    summer in
                    France.

                <h4>
                    The Best Music Videos of 2018
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In 2018, music videos can still be the most powerful way for an artist to introduce us to their
                    creative world,
                    unveil a new aesthetic, or offer an emotional short story. This year saw newcomers like Tierra Whack
                    and Rosalía
                    astound with their ambitious visions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyoncé, JAY-Z, and Childish Gambino used videos to make bold political statements that instantly
                    went viral. And
                    LCD Soundsystem and Hurray for the Riff Raff gave us beautifully shot and acted mini-movies. These
                    bursts of sound
                    and image are readily accessible, mercifully brief, and, at their best, a lot more fulfilling than
                    mindlessly
                    scrolling through Instagram. Here are our 25 favorites from this year.

                <h4>
                    In Sight Out: Liz Phair
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Emerging from the indie-rock boys club of Chicago in the early 1990s, Liz Phair made her name with
                    her 1993
                    masterpiece Exile in Guyville, a song-by-song response to the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It made her a star. This year, to celebrate Exile in Guyville’s 25th anniversary, Phair’s label
                    Matador released
                    Girly-Sound to Guyville, a collection of the home-recorded tapes that she made leading up to
                    Guyville which offer a
                    detailed look at the process and genius behind a feminist rock classic.
